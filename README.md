# friend-finder
App to find compatible friends

## Setup
 +
 +First clone this repo to your local directory.
 +
 +Next, navigate to your repo in your command terminal, and enter:
 +
 +`npm install`
 +
 +This will ensure you have all the necessary NPM packages installed to run this generator.
 +
 +Feel free to load your own starter data into the `friends.js` file, or use the ones already in there. It's ok, I don't know them either.
 +
 +## Overview
 +
 +The home page of the app serves the purposes of telling you about the app.
 +
 +Navigating to the `survey` page will present you with a 12 item questionnaire: name, photo link, and 10 questions to determine your fate.
 +
 +All questions are required.
 +
 +Clicking submit will generate your match and display it to you in a pop modal.
